# Unit Testing Activity
In this part we needed to construct some testing functions that would be executed with the help of NODE, and especially with npm. The tests were written so they expect a certain outcome on the console and therefore, if the requirements are met, the test is successful and if not, it fails. These tests were done on a small program that outputs a greeting to a given name. The trick here is that we had to meet some requirements. For example, if the name was given in capital letters, the output should also be in uppercase. Other scenarios were: if the name was not given and the variable remained null or if there was more than one name given.
