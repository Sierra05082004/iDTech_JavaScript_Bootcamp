# Project Pt 2 - PacMen Factory Activity
In this project we had to make a Pacman factory. The factory consists of a web page that has 2 buttons on it. One of them starts the game and the other makes new Pacman figures. The button that makes new Pacmans can be pushed many times and more Pacmans keep appearing on the screen. The challenging part was to make the Pacmans bounce on the walls of the page but also to push everyone on them into an array with specific randomized statistics. For the movement, we used the DOM and javaScript in order for them to update their position on the screen.
