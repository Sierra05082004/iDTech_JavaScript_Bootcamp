# Fortune Teller Activity
This assignment consists of a small program that allows the user to enter a number between 0 and 10. The program will read the number chosen by the user and print a message about their fortune. If the number is between 0 and 3, the message will say "Ups, You have selected a low fortune", if the number is between 4 and 7 the message will be "You have selected an average fortune" and if the number is between 8 and 10, the output will be "Great! You have selected a good fortune". If the user enters a number that is not between 0 and 10, the program will print "I'm sorry, your fortune can't be read correctly" and "Please enter a fortune value between 0 and 10".
